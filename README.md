# Snek v0.0
(A Snake-inspired game on a torus world)

Snek is a simple game made in Processing 3.5.3 and inspired by the classic game Snake. In Snek, the player moves the Snek by steering its direction towards red dots of food while avoiding its tail (as in Snake). However, instead of being gridded, the Snek can move in any direction, and instead of being walled, the edges are bound together as in a torus, forming a loop. The red dots of food also have varying radii, and the area of a dot is proportional to how much it increases the Snek's length when eaten.
